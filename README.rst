Installation
============

#. Clone the repository::

    git clone https://projects.developer.nokia.com/git/TracKanbanBoard.git trackanbanboard

#. Run setup script::

    cd trackanbanboard
    python setup.py install

#. Enable component in Trac configuration::

    [components]
    trackanbanboard.* = enabled

#. Create/modify wiki page and put `KanbanBoard` processor in it. Empty data will give an error but also the detailed usage instructions::

    This is wiki text:
    {{{
    #!KanbanBoard
    }}}

Data storage
============

Plugin uses Trac tickets as kanban board "cards". Any existing ticket from project can be added to the board and modifed either from board or from default Trac ticket view.

All kanban board specific information (such as column definitions and card order) is stored in macro definition on wiki page. When cards are moved around plugin updates the macro definition and rewrites wiki page.

Example
=======

Here's an example macro definition that produces Kanban board with three columns (New, Ongoing and Done) and shows status and priority fields in ticket dialog::

    {{{
    #!KanbanBoard height=250px
    {
      "columns": [
        { "id": 1, "name": "New", "states": ["new"], "tickets": [23, 24, 25], "wip": 3 },
        { "id": 2, "name": "Ongoing", "states": ["assigned", "accepted", "reopened"], "tickets": [21], "wip": 3 },
        { "id": 3, "name": "Done", "states": ["closed"], "tickets": [22], "wip": 5 }
      ],
      "fields": [
        "status", "priority"
      ]
    }
    }}}
